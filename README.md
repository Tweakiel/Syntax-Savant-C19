## Description üìñ

---

> This is a web-based text editor that can also be installed locally for offline use. It utilizes webpack to bundle all the necessary JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files, resulting in an optimized and efficient deployed site. In addition, the editor leverages plugins to aid in bundling files and transforming ES6+ code into ES5 code that is compatible with web browsers. To save the text, the editor utilizes the idb module to store it in the indexedDB within the browser.
